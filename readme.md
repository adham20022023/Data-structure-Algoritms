## Description

### Stack Implementation with a fixed size of 100 elements

This algorithm is an implementation of the stack data structure using an array. The stack has a fixed size of 100 elements and supports the standard push, pop and peek operations.

### Balanced Parentheses Checking

This algorithm checks if a given string of parentheses is balanced or not. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses and checks if each closing parenthesis matches the most recent opening parenthesis.

### Postfix and Prefix Expression Evaluation

This algorithm evaluates postfix and prefix expressions using a stack. It supports the standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and works by pushing operands onto the stack and performing the corresponding operation when an operator is encountered.

### Queue Implementation using Array

This algorithm is an implementation of the queue data structure using an array. It supports the standard enqueue and dequeue operations and has a fixed size of 100 elements.

### Circular Queue Implementation using Array

This algorithm is an implementation of the circular queue data structure using an array. It supports the standard enqueue and dequeue operations and has a fixed size of 100 elements.

### Singly Linked List Implementation

This algorithm is an implementation of the singly linked list data structure. It supports the standard operations of inserting at the beginning, inserting at the end, deleting from the beginning and deleting from the end of the list.

### Doubly Linked List Implementation

This algorithm is an implementation of the doubly linked list data structure. It supports the standard operations of inserting at the beginning, inserting at the end, deleting from the beginning and deleting from the end of the list.
